# Codveda-Technologies-level-1

I have successfully completed Level 1 all 3 tasks of my Data Analysis journey, where I worked on the Iris Dataset ðŸŒ¸ and explored key concepts:

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values, duplicates, and standardized data formats

ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std deviation)

Visualized distributions using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots

Identified correlations between features

ðŸ”¹ Basic Data Visualization

Created bar plots, line charts, and scatter plots

Customized charts with titles, labels, and legends

Exported plots as images for reporting

ðŸ“Š Through this project, I strengthened my skills in Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) and gained a deeper understanding of data preprocessing and visualization.
